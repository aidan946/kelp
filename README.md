## What is kelp?
kelp (with a lowercase 'k') is a torrent downloading and playback syncing server.

kelp is intended to be hosted on a server with a good internet connection. It allows users to generate a room to allow other users to join via a URL. 

The host before inviting users will enter a torrent/magnet URL and the server will begin downloading it. Once downloaded and users are invited, a player will appear and the host can optionally grant all or each user controller access to pause/play/skip throughout the video from the torrent.

Once the room has been set as 'dry' (no users or playback for the configured time) the server will delete the video to save space (configurable).

## Setup
Will be written when project is functional :^)
